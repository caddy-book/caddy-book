Welcome to the first edition of the Caddy book, heavily inspired by the https://github.com/progit[ProGit project].

This book is open source under a Creative Commons license.

We use the amazing Asciidoc format for the text of the book.

We are keeping the translations in separate repositories rather than subdirectories of the English repository.
See link:CONTRIBUTING.md[the Contributing document] for more information.

== How To Generate the Book

There are two ways to generate e-book content from this source code.

The easiest way is simply to let us do it.
A robot is standing by to look for new work on the main branch and automatically build it for everyone. [TODO]

The other way to generate e-book files is to do so manually with Asciidoctor.
If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, Mobi and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle install
$ make
----

This uses the `asciidoctor`, `asciidoctor-pdf` and `asciidoctor-epub` projects.
