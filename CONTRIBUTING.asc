== Contributing to Caddy Book

=== Licensing

By opening a pull request to this repository, you agree to provide your work under the link:LICENSE.asc[project license].

=== Signaling an Issue

Before signaling an issue, please check that there isn't already a similar one in the bug tracking system.

=== Small Corrections

Errata and basic clarifications will be accepted if we agree that they improve the content. You can also open an issue so we can figure out how or if it needs to be addressed.

If you've never done this before, the https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/[flow guide] might be useful.

=== Large Rewrites

Open an issue for discussion before you start. These changes tend to be very subjective, often only clarifying things for some small percentage of people
and it's rarely worth the time to accept them.

=== Translations

Translations to other languages are highly encouraged. We keep each translation in a separate repository.

Since each translation is a different repository, we can also have different maintainers for each project.
The Caddy Book team simply pulls them in and builds them for the translation teams.
To get automatic builds, translations repositories will have to be under the https://github.com/caddy-book[`caddy-book` organization on GitHub].
